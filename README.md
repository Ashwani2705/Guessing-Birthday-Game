# Guessing-Birthday-Game-Using-java
You can find out the date of the month when your friend was born by asking five questions. 
Each question asks whether the day is in one of the five sets of numbers.

The birthday is the sum of the first numbers in the sets where the day appears. For example, 
if the birthday is 19, it appears in Set1, Set2, and Set5. The first numbers in these three sets 
are 1, 2, and 16. Their sum is 19.
Listing 4.3 gives a program that prompts the user to answer whether the day is in Set1 
(lines 41–44), in Set2 (lines 50–53), in Set3 (lines 59–62), in Set4 (lines 68–71), and in Set5 
(lines 77–80). If the number is in the set, the program adds the first number in the set to day
(lines 47, 56, 65, 74, 83).
